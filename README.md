# de-zoomcamp-proj-sf-business
This is the final project repo of the DE zoomcamp 2025 cohort

## Problem statement and results
In this project, we utlized the data of registered business in San Francisco from https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Registered-Business-Locations-San-Francisco/g8m3-pdis/about_data, and tries to answer the following questions:
1. How long do companies stay in business in SF?
2. What are the most poplular business areas in SF?
3. How many restaurants opens or closes in the past 10 years?

The results are shown in the following dashboard:

## Steps
In this section, we give a step-by-step walkthrough of the project. This will include platform setup with terraform, data ingestion and pre-process with Kestra, detailed data process with dbt, and final dashboard setup with Looker studio.
### Setup Google Cloud Platform and other infrastructures
In this project, we are using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We setup the following:
1. Create a service account with BigQuery Admin, Storage Admin, and Compute Admin.
2. Store the credential file (.json) in ./key folder.
3. Run the main.tf file to establish Data Storage Bitbucket and Bigquery dataset.
(Step 1-3 can be done following the instructions from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2ux7gq3Z0o&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=12)
5. Create a virtual machine (VM).
6. Install docker, docker compose, and Python in the VM.
7. Setup config file in ~/.ssh folder. The file is not shown here as it's rather straightforward and the IP address will vary)
8. Use VSCode to connect to VM
(Step 4-7 can be done following the instructions from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae-CV2KfoN0&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=14)
### Data ingestion with Kestra
After setting up the VM as well as docker compose, you can copy the docker-compose.yml in the repo, and launch Kestra with
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
To interact with Kestra from browser, you should also forward port 8080 from the VM to your localhost. (See 32:45 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae-CV2KfoN0&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=14)
